- 👋 Hi, I’m @lmok617
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, cooking, and striving to be a decent human being.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basics of HTML and CSS through the help of freecodecamp & the Odin Project in any of my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that requires full stack development so that I can observe and learn
- 📫 How to reach me - chat is best!
